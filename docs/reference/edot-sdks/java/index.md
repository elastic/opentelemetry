# EDOT Java

The Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java (EDOT Java) is a customized version of the [OpenTelemetry Java agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Use EDOT Java to start the OpenTelemetry SDK with your Java application, and automatically capture tracing data, performance metrics, and logs. Traces, metrics, and logs can be sent to any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) collector you choose.

With EDOT Java you have access to all the features of the OpenTelemetry Java agent plus:

- Access to SDK improvements and bug fixes contributed by the Elastic team before the changes are available upstream in OpenTelemetry repositories.
- Access to optional features that can enhance OpenTelemetry data that is being sent to Elastic (for example, inferred spans and span stacktrace).

**Ready to try out EDOT Java? Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [Setup page](./setup/index)**.
