# Proxy settings for EDOT SDKs

EDOT SDKs generally use the standard proxy environment variables. However, there are exceptions and limitations depending on the language and exporter type.

## Python SDK

The Python SDK honors `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` only when using the `http/protobuf` exporter.

If you use the default gRPC-based exporter, proxy settings are ignored. To enable proxy support, you can either:

* Switch to the `http/protobuf` exporter, which supports standard proxy environment variables.

* Route telemetry through a local EDOT Collector configured with proxy settings.

## Node.js SDK

The Node.js SDK does not currently support `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `NO_PROXY` by default. You can route telemetry through an EDOT Collector.

## Java SDK

If you’re using Java SDK, you must configure Java system properties using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Refer to [Troubleshooting Java SDK proxy issues](docs-content://troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-sdks/java/proxy-issues.md) for more information.

## Other SDKs

Other EDOT SDKs honor standard proxy environment variables with no additional setup required. For example:

```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy.address>:<port>
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy.address>:<port>
```
