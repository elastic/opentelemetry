# Automatic instrumentation

The SDK can automatically generate telemetry on your behalf. This allows you to get telemetry data for supported targets without having to write [manual instrumentation](manual-instrumentation.md).

## Installation [supported-instrumentations-installation]

All automatic instrumentations are optional. The first step is to install the instrumentations you want to use. Specific targets are supported for automatic instrumentation, each with its own Gradle plugin for installation. 

To install a supported automatic instrumentation, follow these steps:

1. Choose a [supported instrumentation](#supported-instrumentations).
2. Add its Gradle plugin to your project in the same location where the [agent](getting-started.md#gradle-setup) is added.
3. [Initialize the agent](getting-started.md#agent-setup) the same way you would without using automatic instrumentation.

Automatic instrumentations will get installed during the SDK initialization.

```{tip}
You can use instrumentations from [OpenTelemetry Android](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/instrumentation) through the Android instrumentation adapter(#android-instrumentation-adapter).
```

## Compilation behavior

Some automatic instrumentations perform bytecode instrumentation, also known as _byte code weaving_, where your application's code, including code from the libraries it uses, is modified at compile-time. This is similar to what `isMinifyEnabled` does with R8 functionalities, automating code changes that you would otherwise need to make manually. 

Bytecode instrumentation is a common technique which may already be used in your project for use cases such as [code optimization](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#optimization) through R8. While useful, bytecode instrumentation can make compilation take longer to complete. Because of this, the agent provides [a way to exclude](#automatic-instrumentation-configuration) specific build types in your app from byte code changes.

## Configuration [automatic-instrumentation-configuration]

For large projects, you can avoid the added compilation time caused by the [compilation behavior](#compilation-behavior) by excluding build types that don't need the functionality. 

Use the following configuration to exclude build types:

```kotlin
// Your app's build.gradle.kts file
plugins {
    // ...
    id("co.elastic.otel.android.agent")
}

// ...

elasticAgent {
    bytecodeInstrumentation.disableForBuildTypes.set(listOf("debug")) // <1>
}
```

1. By default, the `disableForBuildTypes` list is empty. Add any [build type](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants#build-types) names for which you want to turn off byte code instrumentation.

:::{note}
Turning off byte-code instrumentation might affect the ability of some [automatic instrumentations](#supported-instrumentations) to generate telemetry.

## Supported instrumentations [supported-instrumentations]

The following automatic instrumentations are supported.

### OkHttp

Creates spans for outgoing HTTP requests that are made using the [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) library. This also includes tools that rely on OkHttp to work, such as [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

#### Gradle plugin

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("co.elastic.otel.android.instrumentation.okhttp") version "[latest_version]" // <1>
}
```

1. You can find the latest version [here](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/co.elastic.otel.android.instrumentation.okhttp).

## Adapter for OTel Android instrumentations

```{applies_to}
product: preview
```

You can use any instrumentation from the OpenTelemetry Android [available instrumentations](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/instrumentation) through the OTel instrumentation adapter by following these steps. The adapter is an [extended](/reference/compatibility/nomenclature.md#extended-components) component.

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Add the adapter to your project

Add the Gradle plugin it to your project by including it in your app's `plugins` block. This is the same block where the [agent's plugin](getting-started.md#gradle-setup) should also be added.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("co.elastic.otel.android.instrumentation.oteladapter") version "[latest_version]" // <1>
}
```

1. To find the latest version, refer to [Gradle plugins](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/co.elastic.otel.android.instrumentation.oteladapter).
::::

::::{step} Use an OTel Android instrumentation

After including the adapter in your project, install the desired OTel Android instrumentation by following the installation instructions from its README file.

### Example use case

For example, consider the [HttpURLConnection instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/instrumentation/httpurlconnection), which automatically instruments HTTP requests made with HttpURLConnection.

To have it fully installed, your app's `build.gradle.kts` file should look like this:

```kotlin
plugins {
    // ...
    id("co.elastic.otel.android.instrumentation.oteladapter") // <1>
}

// ...

dependencies {  // <2>
    // ... 
    implementation("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:httpurlconnection-library:AUTO_HTTP_URL_INSTRUMENTATION_VERSION") 
    byteBuddy("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:httpurlconnection-agent:AUTO_HTTP_URL_INSTRUMENTATION_VERSION") // <3>
}
```

1. Make sure the adapter is added.
2. You can find the dependencies needed in the [instrumentation's README file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/instrumentation/httpurlconnection#project-dependencies). The same will be the case for any other instrumentation.
3. The instrumentations that require a byteBuddy dependency do bytecode weaving, as explained in compilation behavior. An extra plugin named `net.bytebuddy.byte-buddy-gradle-plugin` is required to make this work, as shown [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/instrumentation/httpurlconnection#byte-buddy-compilation-plugin). However, the EDOT agent installs it on your behalf, so there's no need for you to do so manually.
