# EDOT Cloud Forwarder for AWS

{{edot-cf}} for AWS provides the EDOT Collector as a Lambda function that collects and forwards logs to Elastic Observability on {{serverless-full}}. {{edot-cf}} for AWS supports the following log sources:

| Log source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| VPC Flow | Logs generated by a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) |
| ELB Access | Logs generated by an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) |
% | CloudWatch {applies_to}`product: planned` | Logs generated by AWS CloudWatch |

Read on to learn how to set up {{edot-cf}} for AWS.

::::{note}
We are working to support other popular log types and sources. Get in touch to let us know of any specific requirements that could influence our plans.
::::

## Prerequisites

::::{important}
{{edot-cf}} for AWS is not currently supported on {{ech}} or self-managed {{stack}}.
::::


To collect logs using {{edot-cf}} for AWS, you need:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} VPC Flow

To collect VPC Flow logs, you need:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- An S3 bucket for storing flow logs
- A flow log configured with the S3 bucket as the destination

:::

:::{tab-item} ELB Access

To collect Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Access logs, you need:

- An ELB of any type (ALB, NLB, CLB)
- An S3 bucket to store the access logs
- Access logging enabled, with the bucket as the destination

:::
<!--
:::{tab-item} CloudWatch

To collect CloudWatch logs, you need:

- A CloudWatch Log Group where logs are stored

:::
-->
::::

In addition, you need to know the URL of the managed OTLP endpoint and the API key for authentication.

::::{dropdown} Steps to retrieve the OTLP endpoint and API key

:::{include} ../_snippets/serverless-endpoint-api.md
:::

In the CloudFormation templates, the OTLP endpoint is set as `OTLPEndpoint`, and the API key is set as `ElasticAPIKey`. 

:::{important}
Trim the API key from `Authorization=ApiKey MYKEYVALUE...` to just `MYKEYVALUE...` before using it as the argument to the `ElasticAPIKey` parameter.
:::
::::

## Deployment considerations

Before deploying {{edot-cf}} for AWS, keep these points in mind:

- Deploy a separate CloudFormation stack for each log type, for example VPC Flow Logs or ELB Logs. Each CloudFormation stack can only process one log source and format at a time.
- Logs stored in S3 must be placed in separate buckets. Each log type should reside in its own dedicated bucket.

## Download the template [download-templates]

Download the CloudFormation template to deploy the appropriate stack based on your log source:

| Log Source | CloudFormation template |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| S3 logs | `https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/s3_logs-cloudformation.yaml` |
% | CloudWatch logs | `https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/cloudwatch_logs-cloudformation.yaml` |

For specific versions, edit `latest` in the URL to the required version in the format `vX.Y.Z`.

## Configure the template

{{edot-cf}} for AWS uses a CloudFormation template to deploy the EDOT Collector as a Lambda function.

### Required settings

These are the required settings you need:

| Setting                                | Description |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `region`                               | AWS region where the CloudFormation stack is to be deployed |
| `stack-name`                           | Name of the CloudFormation stack, for example, `vpc-edot-cf`<br>Do not use the same name for different sources. |
| `OTLPEndpoint`                         | The OTLP endpoint URL used for data ingestion |
| `ElasticApiKey`                        | API key for authentication with Elastic |

### Log source settings

Set the following settings based on the log source:

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} S3

For S3 logs, use the following settings:

| Setting            | Description |
| ------------------ | --- |
| `EdotCloudForwarderS3LogsType` | The encoding format for logs in the S3 bucket. Supported options:<br>- `vpc_flow_log`: VPC Flow logs<br>- `elb_access_log`: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Access logs<br>- `s3_access_log`: S3 Access logs<br>- `json`: JSON-formatted logs |
| `S3LogsJsonEncodingMode` | _(Required if `EdotCloudForwarderS3LogsType` is `json`)_<br>Defines how JSON logs are structured:<br>- `body` _(default)_: Stores logs in the request body<br>- `body_with_inline_attributes`: Logs include inline attributes |
| `SourceS3BucketARN` | Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket where logs are stored. This bucket will trigger the `edot-cloud-forwarder` Lambda function automatically. |

::::
<!--
::::{tab-item} CloudWatch

For CloudWatch logs, use the following settings:

| Setting            | Description |
| ------------------- | --- |
| `SourceCloudWatchLogGroupARN` | Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Log Group where the subscription filter will be created. This Log Group serves as the primary storage location for logs. |

:::{note}
The log group must already exist in your AWS account and region. If the ARN points to a non-existent log group, stack deployment or updates might fail.
:::
::::
-->
:::::

### Optional settings

These are optional settings you can set in the CloudFormation template:

| Setting            | Description |
| ------------------- | --- |
| `EdotCloudForwarderTimeout` | Maximum execution time for the Lambda function, measured in seconds. Default value is `300` seconds. Minimum value is `1` second. Maximum value is `900` seconds. |
| `EdotCloudForwarderVersion` | Version of the EDOT Cloud Forwarder. Expected format is semantic versioning, for example `0.1.5`. Defaults to the latest available patch version. Don't change this value unless advised by Elastic Support. |
| `EdotCloudForwarderMemorySize` | Set the allocated memory for the Lambda function, measured in megabytes. Default value is `1024` MB. Minimum value is `128` MB. Maximum value is `10240` MB. | 
| `EdotCloudForwarderConcurrentExecutions` | Set the maximum number of reserved concurrent executions for the Lambda function. Default value is `50`. Make sure this value doesn't exceed your AWS account's concurrency limit. |


## Deployment examples

The following examples use the CloudFormation template files hosted in the [public S3 bucket](#download-templates).

- Use the `--template-url` flag to reference a template hosted on S3. 
- To always use the most recent stable templates, use the `latest` path. For example, `v0/latest`.  
- To pin a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version tag. For example, `v0/v0.1.5`.  

Alternatively, if you have downloaded the template file, you can use the `--template-body file://<path>` option with a local template file.

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} VPC Flow logs

This example deploys a CloudFormation stack to collect VPC Flow logs stored in an S3 bucket.

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc \
  --template-url https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/s3_logs-cloudformation.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey=SourceS3BucketARN,ParameterValue=your-s3-vpc-bucket-arn \
    ParameterKey=OTLPEndpoint,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=ElasticAPIKey,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=EdotCloudForwarderS3LogsType,ParameterValue="vpc_flow_log"
```
::::

::::{tab-item} ELB Access logs

This example deploys a CloudFormation stack to collect ALB Access logs stored in an S3 bucket.

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-alb \
  --template-url https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/s3_logs-cloudformation.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey=SourceS3BucketARN,ParameterValue=your-s3-alb-bucket-arn \
    ParameterKey=OTLPEndpoint,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=ElasticAPIKey,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=EdotCloudForwarderS3LogsType,ParameterValue="elb_access_log"
```
::::
<!--
::::{tab-item} CloudWatch logs

This example deploys a CloudFormation stack to collect CloudWatch logs sent to a Log Group.

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-cw \
  --template-url https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/cloudwatch_logs-cloudformation.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey=OTLPEndpoint,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=ElasticAPIKey,ParameterValue="<placeholder>" \
    ParameterKey=SourceCloudWatchLogGroupARN,ParameterValue="<your-log-group-arn>"
```

:::{note}
The `--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` flag is required because this CloudFormation template creates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. More specifically, it creates a named IAM role (`LambdaExecutionRole`) for the Lambda function. To acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create or modify IAM resources with custom names, you must specify the `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability. 
:::

::::
:::::

To update an existing CloudFormation stack while preserving some parameter values, follow these steps:

::::::{stepper}

:::::{step} Identify the stack to update

Determine the name of the CloudFormation stack you want to modify.

:::::

:::::{step} Prepare the update command

Use the following structure for your update command:

- Include all required parameters.
- Use `UsePreviousValue=true` for parameters that should remain unchanged.
- Specify `ParameterValue=<new-value>` for parameters that need to be updated.

:::::

:::::{step} Run the `update-stack` command

Run the command with the following parameters:

```sh
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --template-url https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/<template-file-name>.yaml \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --parameters \
      ParameterKey=Param1,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=Param2,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=Param3,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=Param4,ParameterValue=<new-value>
```
::::{dropdown} Example using S3 logs template
For example, to modify the S3 bucket ARN for the `edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc` stack while keeping other parameter values unchanged:

```sh
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --template-url https://edot-cloud-forwarder.s3.amazonaws.com/v0/latest/cloudformation/s3_logs-cloudformation.yaml \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --parameters \
      ParameterKey=OTLPEndpoint,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=ElasticAPIKey,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=EdotCloudForwarderS3LogsType,UsePreviousValue=true \
      ParameterKey=SourceS3BucketARN,ParameterValue=your-new-s3-vpc-bucket-arn
```
::::
:::::

:::::{step} Verify the update

After running the command, check the stack status in the AWS Management Console under **CloudFormation** → **Stacks**. Then, run this command to confirm the updated parameter values:

```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <stack-name>
```
:::::
::::::

## Manual deployment using the CloudFormation Console

You can deploy the stack manually using the AWS Management Console by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation** in the AWS Console.  
2. Select **Create Stack** and choose **With new resources (standard)** to start a fresh deployment.
3. Select one of the following options under **Specify template**:  
   - **Amazon S3 URL (Recommended)**: Use the pre-hosted CloudFormation template stored in the [public S3 bucket](#download-templates).  
   - **Upload a template file**: Download the template from the S3 bucket and upload it manually.
4. Select **Next** and configure all required parameters.  
5. Select **Next** again and check **Acknowledge IAM capabilities**. This is required because the template creates named IAM roles with permissions to access the required resources.  
6. Review your configuration and select **Submit** to deploy the stack.  
7. Monitor the progress until the stack reaches the `CREATE_COMPLETE` state. 

## CloudFormation stack resources

The CloudFormation templates create a number of resources to process logs from a specific log source.

### Resources for S3 logs

This is a list of resources created by the stack when processing S3 logs.

| Resource name               | Type                             | Description |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `CustomNotificationUpdater` | `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` | Custom resource used to manage S3 event notifications dynamically. |
| `LambdaExecutionRole`       | `AWS::IAM::Role`                   | IAM role granting permissions needed for the Lambda function to interact with S3 and other AWS services. |
| `LambdaFunction`            | `AWS::Lambda::Function`            | Core Lambda function responsible for processing incoming logs from S3. This is a key resource in the stack. |
| `LambdaInvokeConfig`        | `AWS::Lambda::EventInvokeConfig`   | Configures error handling and invocation settings for the Lambda function. |
| `LambdaLogGroup`            | `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`               | CloudWatch log group storing logs for the main Lambda function. Useful for debugging and monitoring. |
| `LambdaPermissionS3Bucket`  | `AWS::Lambda::Permission`          | Grants permission for S3 to invoke the Lambda function when new logs arrive. |
| `LambdaS3TriggerPolicy`     | `AWS::IAM::Policy`                 | IAM policy allowing the Lambda function to process events triggered by S3. |
| `NotificationUpdaterLambda` | `AWS::Lambda::Function`            | Utility Lambda function handling S3 event notification updates dynamically. |
| `NotificationUpdaterLambdaLogGroup` | `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`         | CloudWatch log group storing logs for the `NotificationUpdaterLambda` function. |
| `S3FailureBucketARN`               | `AWS::S3::Bucket`                   | ARN of the bucket for storing failed invocations from the `edot-cloud-forwarder` Lambda function, preventing data loss, in the format `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name`. If not defined, the template creates a dedicated failure bucket automatically. |

The main Lambda function, `LambdaFunction`, is the core component for processing S3 logs. S3 event notifications are handled dynamically using `CustomNotificationUpdater` and `NotificationUpdaterLambda`. 

CloudWatch logs ensure detailed monitoring of Lambda executions. IAM roles and permissions control access between S3 and Lambda functions, while `S3FailureBucketARN` prevents data loss by capturing unprocessed logs.
<!--
### Resources for CloudWatch Logs

This is a list of resources created by the stack when CloudWatch logs are the source.

| Resource name                  | Type                             | Description |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `CloudWatchLogSubscriptionFilter` | `AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter` | Defines a filter that forwards logs from a CloudWatch Log Group to the Lambda function. Critical for log processing. |
| `LambdaExecutionRole`              | `AWS::IAM::Role`                   | IAM role granting necessary permissions for the Lambda function to interact with CloudWatch Logs and other AWS services. |
| `LambdaFunction`                   | `AWS::Lambda::Function`            | Core Lambda function responsible for processing incoming logs from CloudWatch. This is a key resource in the stack. |
| `LambdaInvokeConfig`               | `AWS::Lambda::EventInvokeConfig`   | Configures event invocation settings, including error handling and retry behavior. |
| `LambdaLogGroup`                   | `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`               | CloudWatch log group that stores execution logs for the main Lambda function, aiding monitoring and debugging. |
| `LambdaPermissionCloudWatch`       | `AWS::Lambda::Permission`          | Grants permission for CloudWatch Logs to invoke the Lambda function, enabling real-time log streaming. |
| `S3FailureBucketARN`               | `AWS::S3::Bucket`                   | ARN of the bucket for storing failed log events to prevent data loss, in the format `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name`. |

The CloudWatch Log Subscription Filter, `CloudWatchLogSubscriptionFilter`, ensures logs are correctly forwarded to the Lambda function. The Lambda function, `LambdaFunction`, serves as the core processing unit for CloudWatch logs. 

CloudWatch Log Groups help monitor execution performance and debug issues. IAM permissions (`LambdaExecutionRole`, `LambdaPermissionCloudWatch`) control interactions between CloudWatch and Lambda, while the failure bucket, `S3FailureBucketARN`, helps prevent data loss in case of processing errors.
-->
## **Delete a CloudFormation stack**

If you no longer need a deployed stack and want to clean up all associated resources, you can delete it using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --region <stack-region>
```

Deleting a stack will remove all AWS resources created by that stack. However, if you allowed the stack to automatically create a dedicated S3 bucket for failed Lambda invocations, that bucket will not be deleted if it contains objects, because CloudFormation doesn't force-delete non-empty buckets. To remove the bucket entirely, you must empty it manually before deleting it.

If you specified an existing bucket through the `S3FailureBucketARN` parameter instead, that bucket will not be deleted because it is not managed by the stack.

:::{dropdown} Example: Deleting a stack

The following command deletes the `edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc` stack:

```sh
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc \
  --region eu-central-1
```

You can monitor the deletion progress in the AWS Console under **CloudFormation** → **Stacks**, or through this command:

```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --region <stack-region>
```

If the stack deletion fails and remains in a `DELETE_FAILED` state, you can retry the deletion with force mode:

```sh
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
  --stack-name edot-cloud-forwarder-vpc \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --deletion-mode FORCE_DELETE_STACK
```

This forcibly deletes the stack's resources, except any that cannot be deleted, like the failure S3 bucket if it still contains objects. For a complete cleanup, empty the bucket manually before retrying deletion.
