# EDOT Cloud Forwarder for Azure

{{edot-cf}} (CF) for Azure allows you to stream telemetry data from Azure services to an {{es}} cluster. EDOT CF for Azure supports the following sources:

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Activity log | Logs generated by Azure Monitor |
% | Storage account metrics | Metrics generated by an Azure Storage |

Read on to learn how to set up {{edot-cf}} for Azure.

::::{note}
We are working to support other sources. Get in touch to let us know of any specific requirements that might influence our plans.
::::

## Prerequisites

::::{important}
{{edot-cf}} for Azure requires a Managed OTLP endpoint and an API key. Managed OTLP is available for {{serverless-full}} and will soon be available for {{ech}}.

For self-managed deployments, set up an EDOT Collector in [Gateway mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md#gateway-mode) that ingests OTel data from the edge setup into the self-managed Elastic Stack.
::::
To collect telemetry data using {{edot-cf}} for Azure, you need:

- An Azure subscription
- Azure CLI
- Bicep extension for Azure CLI

### Azure subscription

To use {{edot-cf}} for Azure, you need an Azure subscription with permissions to create resources.

The Bicep template for {{edot-cf}} creates the following resources:

- Function App
- App Service plan
- Event Hubs Namespace with two Event Hubs (logs and metrics)
- Storage account
- Application Insights workspace

### Azure CLI

You can use the Azure CLI to deploy and manage resources required for {{edot-cf}}.

To install Azure CLI, refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Bicep extension

{{edot-cf}} for Azure uses Bicep to define all the necessary resources and their dependencies.

After you've installed Azure CLI, install Bicep by running the following command:

```bash
az bicep install
```

## Deployment considerations

Before deploying {{edot-cf}} for Azure, take the following into consideration:

- The logs event hub supports Azure resource logs.
- Support for additional encoding extensions for logs and metrics will be added in future releases.

## Deploy EDOT CF for Azure

Follow these steps to deploy {{edot-cf}} for Azure in a resource group to send telemetry data to the {{motlp}} endpoint.

::::::{stepper}

:::::{step} Retrieve the OTLP endpoint and API key

To find out the URL of the managed OTLP endpoint and the API key for authentication, follow these steps:

::::{dropdown} Steps to retrieve the OTLP endpoint and API key

:::{include} ../_snippets/serverless-endpoint-api.md
:::

In the Bicep templates, the OTLP endpoint is set as `elasticsearchOtlpEndpoint`, and the API key is set as `elasticsearchApiKey`. 

:::{important}
Trim the API key from `Authorization=ApiKey MYKEYVALUE...` to just `MYKEYVALUE...` before using it as the argument to the `elasticsearchApiKey` parameter.
:::
::::
:::::

:::::{step} Set the environment variables
Define the following environment variables:

```sh
export AZURE_LOCATION="<your_region>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<group_name>"
export ELASTICSEARCH_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<your_otlp_endpoint>"
export ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
```
:::::

:::::{step} Create the resource group
Create the resource group that hosts all the resources for {{edot-cf}} for Azure.

```sh
$ az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $AZURE_LOCATION
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<group_name>",
  "location": "<your_region>",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "<group_name>",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```
:::::

:::::{step} Download the Bicep template
Download the Bicep template to deploy {{edot-cf}} for Azure at the following URL: https://ela.st/edot-cf-azure-template
:::::

:::::{step} Deploy the Bicep template
Deploy the Bicep template using the following command:

```sh
az deployment group create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --template-file ecf.bicep \
    --parameters \
        elasticsearchOtlpEndpoint=$ELASTICSEARCH_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
        elasticsearchApiKey=$ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY \
        logsDecoder=ds \ <1>
        metricsDecoder=dcr \ <2>
        eventHubPartitionCount=8 \
        eventHubMessageRetentionInDays=1 \
```

1. To collect Activity logs from a diagnostic settings, set `logsDecoder` to `ds` (diagnostic settings).
2. To collect Storage Account metrics from a Data Collection Rule, set `metricsDecoder` to `dcr` (data collection rules).

For a complete list of parameters, refer to [Configure the template](#configure-the-template).
:::::

:::::{step} Collect telemetry data
Follow these instructions to collect telemetry data depending on your use case.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Activity logs
Create a diagnostic setting to collect Activity logs from an Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, open **Subscriptions** from the search bar.
2. Select the Azure subscription from which you want to collect Activity logs.
3. Go to **Activity log** → **Export Activity Logs** → **Add diagnostic setting**.

## Configure the template

{{edot-cf}} for Azure uses a Bicep template to deploy the EDOT CF.

The following parameters are available in the Bicep template:

| Parameter                        | Default | Description                                                          | Available options                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `elasticsearchOtlpEndpoint`      |         | OTLP service endpoint.                                               |                                                                        |

## Resource group resources

The Bicep template creates a number of resources to process logs from a specific log source.

This is the list of resources created by the Bicep template.

| Resource name         | Type                                      | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eventHubNamespace`   | `Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces`           | Event Hubs namespace to host the event hubs to stream logs and metrics.                                  |
| `logsEventHub`        | `Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/eventhubs` | Event hub for the logs.                                                                                  |
| `metricsEventHub`     | `Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/eventhubs` | Event hub for the metrics.                                                                               |
| `storageAccount`      | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`       | Storage Account container to store the Event Hubs trigger checkpoint information and the failed messages. |
| `hostingPlan`         | `Microsoft.Web/serverfarms`               | Hosting plan that runs the function app.                                                                 |
| `functionApp`         | `Microsoft.Web/sites`                     | The function app that runs the EDOT Collector.                                                           |
| `applicationInsights` | `Microsoft.Insights/components`           | Application Insights instance to monitor the application.                                                |

Note the following:

- The `eventHubNamespace` hosts the two event hubs responsible for receiving logs and metrics from Azure services. 
- The `storageAccount` stores the checkpoint information for the Event Hub triggers, and it also hosts the failed logs and metrics in the `logs-error-container` and `metrics-error-container` containers. 
- The `functionApp` is the core component responsible for running the OTel collector inside the Azure Function. 

## Remove the resource group

If you no longer need the resources and want to remove them, use the following command:

```sh
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

This removes all the resources in the resource group.

:::{warning}
If you remove the resource group, data that's still unprocessed will be lost.
