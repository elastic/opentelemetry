# Quickstart guides

Learn how to set up the Elastic Distributions for OpenTelemetry (EDOT) to monitor Kubernetes, applications, and hosts. 

The guides cover installing the EDOT Collector, enabling auto-instrumentation, and configuring data collection for metrics, logs, and traces in Elastic Observability.

Select a guide based on the environment of your target system and your Elastic deployment model.
