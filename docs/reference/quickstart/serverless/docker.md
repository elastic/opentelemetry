# Quickstart - Docker - Serverless

‚òÅÔ∏è Elastic Cloud Serverless
{: .label .label-green }

The quick start for Docker with Elastic Cloud Serverless will guide you through setting up the EDOT Collector and EDOT SDKs to collect host metrics,
logs and application traces and send the data through OTLP to your Elastic Serverless Project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following requirements are present:

- Docker installed and running.
- An Elastic Serverless Project deployment.

## Instructions

1. Create a `otel-collector-config.yml` file with your EDOT collector configuration. See the [configuration reference](../../_edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md) for "Managed OTLP Endpoint" for more details.

2. Retrieve the `Elastic OTLP Endpoint` and the `Elastic API Key` for your Serverless Project by [following these instructions](./#retrieve-connection-details-for-your-project).

3. Create a `.env` file with the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Elastic Cloud credentials:

   ```bash
   HOST_FILESYSTEM=/
   DOCKER_SOCK=/var/run/docker.sock
   ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL=true
   COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE=elastic/elastic-agent:9.0.0
   ELASTIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
   ELASTIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint_here>
   OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG=/path/to/otel-collector-config.yml
   ```

4. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
    otel-collector:
      image: ${COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE}
      container_name: otel-collector
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 1.5G
      restart: unless-stopped
      command: ["--config", "/etc/otelcol-config.yml" ]
      network_mode: host
      user: 0:0
      volumes:
        - ${HOST_FILESYSTEM}:/hostfs:ro
        - ${DOCKER_SOCK}:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
        - ${OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG}:/etc/otelcol-config.yml
      environment:
        - HOST_FILESYSTEM
        - ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL
        - ELASTIC_API_KEY
        - ELASTIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        - STORAGE_DIR=/usr/share/elastic-agent
   ```

5. Start the collector by running:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **(Optional) Instrument your applications**

 To collect telemetry from applications running on the host where you installed the EDOT Collector, 
  instrument your target applications following the setup instructions for the corresponding language:

    - [.NET](../../edot-sdks/dotnet/setup)
    - [Java](../../edot-sdks/java/setup)
    - [Node.js](../../edot-sdks/nodejs/setup)
    - [PHP](../../edot-sdks/php/setup)
    - [Python](../../edot-sdks/python/setup)

    Configure your SDKs to send the data to the local EDOT Collector using OTLP/gRPC (`http://localhost:4317`) or OTLP/HTTP (`http://localhost:4318`).
