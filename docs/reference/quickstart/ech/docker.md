# Quickstart for Docker on Elastic Cloud Hosted

Learn how to set up the EDOT Collector and EDOT SDKs in a Docker environment with {{ech}} (ECH) to collect host metrics, logs, and application traces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following requirements are present:

- Docker installed and running.
- The **[System](integration-docs://reference/system/index.md)** integration is installed in {{kib}}. Select **Add integration only** to skip the agent installation, as only the integration assets are required.

## Guided setup

:::{include} ../../_snippets/guided-instructions.md
:::

## Manual installation

Follow these steps to deploy the EDOT Collector and EDOT OTel SDKs in Docker with ECH.

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Create the config file

Create the `otel-collector-config.yml` file with your EDOT Collector configuration. Refer to the [configuration reference](/reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md).
::::

::::{step} Retrieve your settings

:::{include} ../../_snippets/retrieve-credentials.md
:::
::::

::::{step}Create the .env file

Create an `.env` file with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your Elastic Cloud credentials:
   
   ```bash subs=true
   HOST_FILESYSTEM=/
   DOCKER_SOCK=/var/run/docker.sock
   ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL=true
   COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE=elastic/elastic-agent:{{edot-collector-version}}
   ELASTIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
   ELASTIC_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint_here>
   OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG=/path/to/otel-collector-config.yml
   ```
::::

::::{step} Create the compose file

Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
    otel-collector:
      image: ${COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE}
      container_name: otel-collector
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 1.5G
      restart: unless-stopped
      command: ["--config", "/etc/otelcol-config.yml" ]
      network_mode: host
      user: 0:0
      volumes:
        - ${HOST_FILESYSTEM}:/hostfs:ro
        - ${DOCKER_SOCK}:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
        - ${OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG}:/etc/otelcol-config.yml
      environment:
        - HOST_FILESYSTEM
        - ELASTIC_API_KEY
        - ELASTIC_ENDPOINT
        - ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL
        - STORAGE_DIR=/usr/share/elastic-agent
   ```
::::

::::{step} Start the Collector

Start the Collector by running:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
::::

::::{step} (Optional) Instrument your applications

To collect telemetry from applications running on the host where you installed the EDOT Collector, 
instrument your target applications following the setup instructions for the corresponding language:

   - [.NET](/reference/edot-sdks/dotnet/setup/index.md)
   - [Java](/reference/edot-sdks/java/setup/index.md)
   - [Node.js](/reference/edot-sdks/nodejs/setup/index.md)
   - [PHP](/reference/edot-sdks/php/setup/index.md)
   - [Python](/reference/edot-sdks/python/setup/index.md)

   Configure your SDKs to send the data to the local EDOT Collector using OTLP/gRPC (`http://localhost:4317`) or OTLP/HTTP (`http://localhost:4318`).
