### Collector Limitations
The EDOT collector has some limitations which are mostly inherited from the upstream components, see the [full list](docs/EDOT-collector/edot-collector-limitations.md) here before troubleshooting.

### üîß Troubleshooting Quick Reference

* **Check Logs**: Review the Collector‚Äôs logs for error messages.
* **Validate Configuration:** Use the `--dry-run` option to test configurations.
* Enable Debug Logging: Run the Collector with `--log-level=debug` for detailed logs.
* **Check Service Status:** Ensure the Collector is running with `systemctl status <collector-service>` (Linux) or `tasklist` (Windows).
* **Test Connectivity:** Use `telnet <endpoint> <port>` or `curl` to verify backend availability.
* **Check Open Ports:** Run netstat `-tulnp or lsof -i` to confirm the Collector is listening.
* **Monitor Resource Usage:** Use top/htop (Linux) or Task Manager (Windows) to check CPU & memory.
* **Validate Exporters:** Ensure exporters are properly configured and reachable.
* **Verify Pipelines:** Use `otelctl` diagnose (if available) to check pipeline health.
* **Check Permissions:** Ensure the Collector has the right file and network permissions.
* **Review Recent Changes:** Roll back recent config updates if the issue started after changes.
