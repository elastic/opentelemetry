# EDOT .NET opinionated defaults

When using EDOT .NET, you are opted into Elastic defaults for tracing, metrics and logging. These defaults are designed to provide a quicker getting-started
experience by automatically enabling data collection from instrumentation signals without requiring as much up-front code as the upstream
"vanilla" OpenTelemetry SDK. For most applications, these defaults should be satisfactory, however, they may be overridden for advanced use cases.
