Learn how to set up the EDOT Collector and EDOT SDKs in a Docker environment with Elastic Cloud Hosted to collect host metrics, logs and application traces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following requirements are present:

- Docker installed and running.
- An Elastic Cloud deployment.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the EDOT Collector and EDOT OTel SDKs in Docker with ECH.

1. Create the `otel-collector-config.yml` file with your EDOT Collector configuration. Refer to the [configuration reference](../../_edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md).

2. Retrieve the **Elasticsearch Endpoint** and the **Elastic API Key** for your Elastic Cloud deployment by [following these instructions](./#retrieving-connection-details-for-your-elastic-cloud-deployment).

3. Create an `.env` file with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your Elastic Cloud credentials:
   
   ```bash
   HOST_FILESYSTEM=/
   DOCKER_SOCK=/var/run/docker.sock
   ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL=true
   COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE=elastic/elastic-agent:9.0.0
   ELASTIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
   ELASTIC_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint_here>
   OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG=/path/to/otel-collector-config.yml
   ```

4. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
    otel-collector:
      image: ${COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_IMAGE}
      container_name: otel-collector
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 1.5G
      restart: unless-stopped
      command: ["--config", "/etc/otelcol-config.yml" ]
      network_mode: host
      user: 0:0
      volumes:
        - ${HOST_FILESYSTEM}:/hostfs:ro
        - ${DOCKER_SOCK}:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
        - ${OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONFIG}:/etc/otelcol-config.yml
      environment:
        - HOST_FILESYSTEM
        - ELASTIC_API_KEY
        - ELASTIC_ENDPOINT
        - ELASTIC_AGENT_OTEL
        - STORAGE_DIR=/usr/share/elastic-agent
   ```

5. Start the Collector by running:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **(Optional) Instrument your applications**

   To collect telemetry from applications running on the host where you installed the EDOT Collector, 
   instrument your target applications following the setup instructions for the corresponding language:

    - [.NET](../../edot-sdks/dotnet/setup)
    - [Java](../../edot-sdks/java/setup)
    - [Node.js](../../edot-sdks/nodejs/setup)
    - [PHP](../../edot-sdks/php/setup)
    - [Python](../../edot-sdks/python/setup)

    Configure your SDKs to send the data to the local EDOT Collector using OTLP/gRPC (`http://localhost:4317`) or OTLP/HTTP (`http://localhost:4318`).
